# Web-Scraping-Challenge
**Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars**  
In this assignment, I created a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines what the tasks I completed.  
# Step 1 - Scraping  
The initial scrape of 4 websites was completed using Jupyter Notebook, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter. I scraped the websites for the following information:  
1. **NASA Mars News website** - scraped for the latest News Title and Paragraph Text;   
2. **JPL Mars Space Images website** - scraped for the Featured Image;  
3. **Mars Facts website** - scraped for a table containing facts about Mars;  
4. **Mars Hemispheres website** - scraped for high resolution images of each of Mars's hemispheres.  
# Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application  
Using MongoDB with Flask templating, I created a new HTML page that displayed all of the information that was scraped from the URLS above.
